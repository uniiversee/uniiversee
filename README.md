## Hi there 👋

I’m uniiversee.

I work with reverse engineering, low-level programming, and binary analysis.
If it runs, I can take it apart and understand how it works.

My focus is on memory analysis, game internals, anti-tamper mechanisms, and security research.
Most of my work is private.

I mainly code in C/C++, with a strong interest in x86 internals, debugging, and system behavior.

I don’t ship flashy projects — I ship things that work.
